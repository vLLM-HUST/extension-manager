# Paper build and evidence contract

Paper lead and accountable owner: `ShuhaoZhangTony` (张书豪). Research,
artifact, and submission decisions are PI-led/self-driven; student
contributions are optional and non-blocking.

This is a venue-neutral, two-column systems-paper draft. It intentionally does
not claim compliance with an unconfirmed OSDI, SOSP, EuroSys, ACM, or USENIX
submission year. Adapt the class and anonymity requirements only after the
venue is fixed.

Build:

```bash
cd paper
make
make validate-results
make check-evidence-summary
# Reproducible XeTeX-based build without a system TeX Live installation:
make tectonic
```

The default build uses `latexmk` with `pdflatex` and BibTeX. The alternative
target uses Tectonic's XeTeX engine and integrated BibTeX pass. The vendored
USENIX style selects only engine-supported `microtype`, `inputenc`, and
`breakurl` behavior, so both targets consume the same `main.tex` without a
generated source patch. Override either executable with `LATEXMK=/path` or
`TECTONIC=/path`. `main.pdf` and intermediate files are ignored by Git.

Evidence rules:

- Observed values must point to a raw artifact and exact code/runtime identity.
- Planned cells use JSON `null` and `status: "planned"`; they are never encoded
  as zero.
- Failed runs remain records with failure class and phase.
- Formal cells use at least three independent service starts and record arm
  order, process topology, warm/cold state, model/workload, hardware, and every
  model/API call.
- Aggregates may not hide a failed provider, process topology, or version tuple.
- A figure/table generator must reject mixed identities and missing required
  provenance before producing a paper result.
- Artifact-backed counts and modeled metrics in `main.tex` come from the
  checked-in `generated/evidence-summary.tex`. Regenerate it with `make
  evidence-summary`; `make check-evidence-summary` fails if it is stale or if
  the corpus, planner, formal-status, and adapter-registry inputs disagree.
- `../docs/research/claims-to-experiment-matrix.json` separates each paper
  claim from its falsifier, evidence authority, and experiment. The first
  formal-real preregistration is
  `../experiments/false_effective/first-formal-real-study.json`; validation
  keeps it pre-admission while the producer and adapter registry are absent.
- `../experiments/false_effective/first-formal-real-deployment.json` is the
  separate registration-review packet. It must bind all three arms, all five
  lifecycle sources, producer admission, deployment identity, and review gates
  before admission; it does not replace the runtime adapter registry.

Alignment:

| Governance item | Paper location |
|---|---|
| Research charter | Sections 1--3 |
| Issue #2 / M0 taxonomy and failure model | Sections 2, 3, 7 |
| Issue #4 / M1 capability and conflict planner | Sections 4.2--4.4, H2 |
| Issue #3 / M2 lifecycle, runtime evidence, rollback | Sections 4.5--4.8, H1/H3 |
| Issue #5 / program, two-week gate, stop-loss | Sections 1, 7, 9 |
| M3 cost gate | H4 and Section 7 |

`artifacts/results.schema.json` is the machine contract. The example is planned,
not a measured result. Run `make validate-results` before admitting artifacts.
The ECPA interoperability contract is versioned under `../spec/`; the Manager
is a reference implementation rather than the standard itself.

Open scientific and evaluation decisions that must not be silently promoted to
claims are tracked in [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md).
