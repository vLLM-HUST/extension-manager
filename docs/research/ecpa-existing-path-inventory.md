# ECPA existing plugin-path inventory and next experiments

Snapshot: vLLM-HUST `main`
`5415fab7bf79384a4e1b60d7fc9f13fdf1c59b91` and extension-manager `main`
`a1198447ce76b9b5c4b5d743af63e3f31911e81d` before the journal-adapter update.

## Existing paths and Phase A coverage

The existing `vllm.plugins.load_plugins_by_group` uses Python entry-point
metadata, applies `VLLM_PLUGINS`, and calls `EntryPoint.load()`. No replacement
loader was added. `load_general_plugins` remains guarded once per process and
is reached from argument/config construction, async CLI parser construction,
V1 EngineCore construction, worker construction, and lazy model-registry
loading. Consequently process0, engine-core, and worker processes can each
produce their own host identity and epoch.

Phase A instruments that shared discovery/resolution path and the general
plugin callable path. It proves synthetic ordering and negative behavior:
discovery does not imply resolution, resolution does not imply invocation,
call failure does not emit invocation, an allowlist skip is explicit, repeated
general loading does not duplicate evidence, and the disabled observer leaves
the existing behavior unchanged.

Known gaps are explicit. Endpoint plugins have additional factory,
required-task, router-attachment, and app-state initialization stages. Platform
plugins execute detection functions and choose exactly one platform. IO
processor and stat-logger groups have their own consumers. Phase A observes
their common entry-point discovery/resolution only; it does **not** call their
later stages `invoked`. This avoids false evidence until each consumer's true
effect boundary is separately instrumented.

## Field provenance

| Field | Authoritative source |
|---|---|
| event and entry-point tuple | host loader around `importlib.metadata.EntryPoint` |
| hostname/PID/start identity | running host process and `/proc/self/stat` |
| role/ordinal | native vLLM-HUST EngineCore/worker entry path for formal evidence; launch environment only for compatibility audit events |
| process epoch | derived from PID/start ticks after host binding for formal evidence; launch environment only for compatibility audit events |
| assignment source | host code labels native binding versus compatibility environment identity; included in event ID and checked fail-closed at formal translation |
| observation time | host wall clock (`time.time_ns`), not a monotonic clock |
| Plan/launch ID | trusted launch environment; checked at ingestion |
| observation kind and scheduler dispatch identity | native vLLM-HUST policy controller and host-side recomputation |
| plugin ID/artifact digest | absent in raw event; selected Plan only |
| evidence digest | SHA-256 of exact received raw bytes |

General Python plugins execute as trusted in-process extensions. This evidence
does not prevent an adversarial plugin from importing or modifying observer
internals. A deployment-controlled sink and signing boundary are required;
trusted launcher injection, authenticated transport, durable outbox, and
malicious-plugin isolation are outside Phase A.

The current vLLM-HUST wire includes scheduler-specific observation kind,
binding status, occurrence, controller, invocation sequence, and dispatch
identity fields introduced by the native preemption seam. The extension-manager
receiver and deployment-owned JSONL journal must accept and validate this exact
current wire before a formal-real cell can run. A legacy Phase A parser that
rejects these added fields is not a functioning adapter.

## Frozen real-plugin experiments for Apei

Phase A infrastructure is PI-owned and already implemented. Apei's later task
is limited to these two experiments; neither result may be claimed until raw
artifacts and commands are checked in.

1. Run one pinned BidKV general-plugin cell across process0, engine-core, and
   every worker. Preserve commit IDs, launch environment, raw events, accepted
   signed statements, process inventory, and a negative missing-worker or
   stale-epoch case. Report startup and event-to-acceptance latency plus event
   bytes and signing/verifying cost.
2. Run one pinned second plugin on a different existing consumer path
   (endpoint or platform). Instrument that consumer's actual effect boundary,
   then preserve the same artifacts plus one factory/detection failure and one
   Plan/entry-point mismatch. Do not reuse general-plugin `resolved` as proof
   that endpoint routes or a platform became effective.

Each experiment must link its implementation PR, record hardware/software
versions and exact reproduction commands, and report failures as failures. A
synthetic test, import, package installation, or unsigned host event is not a
real-plugin E2E result.
